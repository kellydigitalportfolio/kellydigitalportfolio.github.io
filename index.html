   <h1> My Goal!!</h1>
  </head>
  <body>
<h4 class="body">My goal is  to manage my time better. My goal has improved a lot over the span of this school year. At the beginning of the year I did all my homework the night before it was due even if we had a week to work on it instead of spread it out. Now I do a little bit of each piece every night so I don't cram it all in one day. I wouldn't change my goal at all because I have improved a lot from the beginning of the year until now. 
    
     <h1>Stretch</h1>
 

<h4 class="body">My stretch was procrastinating. I think that my stretch has gotten a little bit better. Now I am not saving everything until the last minute like I did with my annotations. I usually don't do any homework on the weekend unless it is due on Monday like literature is.  </h4>
      </h4>
      <h1>Strength</h1>


    <h4 class="body"> My strength was working in groups. I don't think that working in groups is my strength anymore. I have become more used to working independently that I am as good as it as I am with working in groups. Maybe even better. In my annotations for social studies we have to work by ourselves and my annotations at the begining of the year were not very good but now they are much better. </h4>
